## User Stories

* As a user I should be able to find out the purpose of the website and what it is about from the home page.
* As a user I should be able to see a list of rides and search for them on the rides page.
* As a user, on each ride container I should be able to click open a link to a modal with rating/reviewing rides form for it to be submitted to the database and the reviews should available to read on the website somewhere.
* As a user I should be able to register an account.
* As a user I should be able to login to my account.
* As a user I expect the website to be responsive on a range of screen sizes.
